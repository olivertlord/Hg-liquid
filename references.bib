It is shown that to determine the volume dependence of the Grüneisen parameter, not only shock-wave and static compression data, but also experimental information on heat capacity, bulk moduli, volume, and thermal expansion coefficient at zero pressure need to be taken into account. Intrinsic anharmonicity is of great importance at construction of EoS at high temperatures and x=V/V 0>1. Cross-comparison of the current equations of state with independent measurements shows that these EoS may be used as the internally consistent and independent pressure scales in a wide range of temperatures and pressures.}},

abstract = {{The atomic-scale structure, melting curve, and equation of state of liquid gallium has been measured to high pressure (p) and high temperature (T) up to 26 GPa and 900 K by in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations up to 33.4 GPa and 1000 K are in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements, providing detailed insight at the level of pair distribution functions. The results reveal an absence of dimeric bonding in the liquid state and a continuous increase in average coordination number n¯GaGa from 10.4(2) at 0.1 GPa approaching ∼12 by 25 GPa. Topological cluster analysis of the simulation trajectories finds increasing fractions of fivefold symmetric and crystalline motifs at high p-T. Although the liquid progressively resembles a hard-sphere structure towards the melting curve, the deviation from this simple description remains large (≥40\%) across all p-T space, with specific motifs of different geometries strongly correlating with low local two-body excess entropy at high p-T.}},

abstract = {{We present BurnMan, an open-source mineral physics toolbox to determine elastic properties for specified compositions in the lower mantle by solving an Equation of State (EoS). The toolbox, written in Python, can be used to evaluate seismic velocities of new mineral physics data or geodynamic models, and as the forward model in inversions for mantle composition. The user can define the composition from a list of minerals provided for the lower mantle or easily include their own. BurnMan provides choices in methodology, both for the EoS and for the multiphase averaging scheme. The results can be visually or quantitatively compared to observed seismic models. Example user scripts show how to go through these steps. This paper includes several examples realized with BurnMan: First, we benchmark the computations to check for correctness. Second, we exemplify two pitfalls in EoS modeling: using a different EoS than the one used to derive the mineral physical parameters or using an incorrect averaging scheme. Both pitfalls have led to incorrect conclusions on lower mantle composition and temperature in the literature. We further illustrate that fitting elastic velocities separately or jointly leads to different Mg/Si ratios for the lower mantle. However, we find that, within mineral physical uncertainties, a pyrolitic composition can match PREM very well. Finally, we find that uncertainties on specific input parameters result in a considerable amount of variation in both magnitude and gradient of the seismic velocities.}},
